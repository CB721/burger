Eat-Da-Burger is an application that displays a list of burgers for the customer.  The user can select the burger they would like from the "Menu" section by clicking the "Devour It!" button.  Once they click the button, the chosen burger is moved to the "Eaten Burgers" section.  

The customer also has the option of requesting a special burger.  They simply type in the name of the burger they want, click "Add to menu" and then they will be able to select it to devour.  If they do not type anything into the "Add burger" form, they will be prompted to type something in.

All of the burgers are stored in the database.  They are assigned a boolean "Devoured" value when they are entered by the user.  If the "Devoured" value is true, the burger is placed in the "Eaten Burgers" section.  If true, it is placed in the "Menu" section.
